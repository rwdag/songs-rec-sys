# songs-rec-sys
A simple university project focused on building a recommender system using Spotify data

In this repository you will find a Jupyter Notebook containing the work that me and a classmate of mine did for an Univeristy project.
The main goal of our project was to build a songs recommender using a Spotify dataset that was provided to us. While not having actual users' data proved to be extremely challenging
for our task, we ultimately found a way to (sort of) overcome this by randomly generating such data. 
If this brief description managed to catch your attention I happily encourage you to take a look at the Notebook to see our work!
Thank you and enjoy!
